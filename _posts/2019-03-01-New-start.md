A few months ago, I decided to open a dev blog. I'll speak about some findings in my personal projects, or my opinion about other projects all over Internet.

In the first entry, I'll describe my project [alterego](https://github.com/Anarkis/alterego) and what I found interesting about it.

See you soon!
